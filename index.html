    <h1>How to Change Your Guitar Strings</h1>

      <p>
        Break a string? Or are your strings starting to feel a little grimy?
        Old strings can be difficult to play on <i>and</i> they can even ruin your guitar's tone!
        Changing strings can be a tricky process, so new players tend to avoid changing strings.
        In this guide, I will show you how to change strings on an electric guitar 
        (the process for an acoustic guitar is slightly different, and I may cover that in a seperate post.)
        Once you follow these easy steps, you'll be a pro at changing strings in no time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we get started, here are a couple things to keep in mind. Never change string gauges unless you know what you are doing (string gauges determine how thick the strings are and how much tension they provide).
        Doing so without adjusting other things on the guitar could cause the neck of your guitar to bend!
        On the same note, changing string guages often times will require you to change the nut, as thicker strings may not fit in your current one or thinner strings might be too loose.
        Finally, this step-by-step tutorial will be on a guitar with a <i>string-through</i> construction, meaning that the strings pass through the body of the guitar. Changing strings for other types of guitar, like acoustic guitars, is a slightly different process.

      <ul>
        <li>an electric guitar with <i>string-through</i> construction</li>
        <li>a new set of strings</li>
        <li>a pair of wire cutters</li>
        <li>a philips-head screwdriver</li>
        <li>a tuner</li>

    <div class="blackwhite">
      <h3>Part 1: Taking off the old strings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Loosen all your old strings until they are floppy. (Using a string winder could speed up this process) This step is important because just cutting the strings without doing so could cause damage to the neck from the sudden change in tension (also because it will prevent strings from hitting you in the eye when you cut them).</li>
          <li>Cut the strings near the headstock using the wire cutters, take care not to scratch your guitar!</li>
          <li>Take the little scraps of string left at the tuners and toss them in the trash, you won't be needing those any more.</li>
          <li>Grab the remaining part of the string and try to push it through the hole where it comes out. It should come out the other end. (If your guitar has a back plate that covers where the strings come out, using a screwdriver to take off the plate might make this process easier)</li>
          <li>If you wish, you may hold on to these old strings and take them to your local guitar store to have the recycled.</li>
       </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="blackwhite">
      <h3>Part 2: Prepping the new strings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your package of new strings. Some brands may color coordinate their strings by the ball ends to show you which order they go in, while some may have each string in an individually labeled package. Either way, the thickest string (the string with the biggest number) should always go on the top (the string closest to your body when playing).</li>
          <li>Run those strings through the same holes through the same holes you pulled the old strings through, keeping in mind the order of the strings.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="blackwhite">
      <h3>Part 3: Installing the new strings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Align all the tuners so that all the holes face the neck of the guitar.</li>
          <li>Take a string and align it with its according slot on the nut of the guitar and then pull it through the appropriate tuner.</li>
          <li>Pulling the string tight with one hand, cut the string above the tuner about two tuning peg's distance from the tuner.</li>
          <li>Make a sharp bend in the string so that the string will catch on the tuning peg. Then, start winding the string, ensuring that there is enough tension on the string. (using a string winder will speed up this process)</li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>Make sure that the string is on the correct side of the tuning peg so that it aligns stright with the nut slot.</li>
      <!-- used the <b> tag -->
              <li>Try to make string move wind <b>down</b> the tuning peg, which will help with tuning stability.</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Repeat for all the strings, again keeping in mind the order of the strings.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="blackwhite">
      <h3>Part 4: Tuning the new strings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Because the strings are new, they will tend to lose their tension.</li>
          <li>After getting the strings on, tug on each string a couple times to tighten the coil around the tuning peg.</li>
          <li>Tune each string to its proper note, which would be EADGBE in standard tuning.</li>
          <li>Do some more string bending and some playing befor tuning again.</li>
          <li>Repeat the above steps until the guitar stays in tune.</li>
        </ol>
